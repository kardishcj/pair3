This repository contains an R markdown file (pair3_updated2.Rmd) which was used to gather web based data from the American National Election Studies database for a project involving a voter turnout model for Millennials. The data had to be cleaned  and we conducted basic decritptive statistics to address our research question. The results are demonstrated using dynamically generated tales and figures and are described as well. It was knitted to a PDF (pair3_updated2.pdf). 

The folder also contains data that has been proposed for the project, marked anes_timeseries_2012 in Stata's .dta format and SPSS' .sav format.It also contains other folders that showcase the work along the way.
