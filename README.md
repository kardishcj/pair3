The 3rd Pair Assignment for Intro to Collaborative Social Science Research

This repository contains an R markdown file (pair3_updated2.Rmd) which was used to gather data from the American National Election Studies database for a project involving a voter turnout model for Millennials. The data had to be minimally cleaned and transformed and we conducted basic decritptive statistics to address our research question. The results are demonstrated using dynamically generated tables and figures and are described as well. It was knitted to a PDF (pair3_updated2.pdf). 

The folder also contains the data file that we used for this project, marked anes_timeseries_2012 in Stata's .dta format and SPSS' .sav format.It also contains other folders that showcase the work along the way, as there were a few hiccups.
