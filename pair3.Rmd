[Will try to find a way to simply download straight from the web to eliminate the need to read it in the old-fashioned way (which is preferable to him, of course).] 
In terms of the structure of the assignment, we begin with a brief explanation of the data source.

What we are trying to do, is see if traditional indicators of voter turnout have the same predictive power across generations. We would also like to see if new indicators, gender and race, hold more predictive power with Millennials than the "traditional" ones do. We feel the traditional indicators will not hold as strongly with the Millennial generation due to it's compisition and values. The ANES survey encompasses....  justify our exclusive use of the single ANES data source.... Variables used include... and are coded: 


Given that our model will ultimately isolate the effects of our chosen turnout predictors on various age groups, we first need to break our giant panel data set into smaller data frames by age bands. This will entail having one age band exclusively for Millennials, who, at the time of the 2012 election, were 18-32 years of age, based on the definition used by the Pew Research Center and other organizations. The next age band will be Generation X, people born between 1965-1979, which places them between the ages of 33 and 47. Next comes the Baby Boomers, who were born between 1946 and 1964 and ran from ages 48 to 66 at the time of the 2012 election.The Silent Generation, born between 1925 and 1945, accounts for the age band of 67 to 87. Because there are so few observations in the data set who are older than 87, they will not be included.

```{r}
#rm(list = ls()) this command clears your environment
#setwd('C:/Users/Chris/Documents/R/col_soc_science')
library(foreign)
library(dplyr)

anes <- read.dta("anes_timeseries_2012_Stata12.dta")

age_df <- table(anes$dem_age_r_x) %>% as.data.frame() #creates a frequency table of the 
#key age variable that's in the readalbe format of a data frame so we can get a sense of what the data looks like.

anes_genY <- subset(anes, anes$dem_age_r_x > 17 & anes$dem_age_r_x < 33) #creates Millennial subset
anes_genX <-  subset(anes, anes$dem_age_r_x > 32 & anes$dem_age_r_x < 48) #creates Generation X subset
anes_boomer <- subset(anes, anes$dem_age_r_x > 47 & anes$dem_age_r_x < 67) #creates Baby Boomer subset
anes_silent <- subset(anes, anes$dem_age_r_x > 66 & anes$dem_age_r_x < 88) #creates Silent Generation subset

#Creating a new variable for marital status

marital_status <- subset(anes, anes$dem_marital)

```

Creating the age groups necessarily required discarding some bizarre outliers. 60 observations are coded with the age -2, for instance. 

Might actually be worth giving some simple statistics about the age of respondents overall.
